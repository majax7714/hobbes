# go/ — policy engine, tool proxy, flight recorder

Go module `github.com/majax7714/hobbes/go`. Standard layout: `cmd/` for
binaries, `internal/` for packages.

- `internal/policy/` — the single implementation of Hobbes policy semantics:
  strict-YAML policy files (ADR-001), the box → repo → folder chain loader
  (with the built-in tfstate deny floor, ADR-011), and the resolution
  algorithm (deny overrides allow, most-specific-wins shadowing, escalate
  tier — ADR-002).
- `internal/recorder/` — the flight recorder: append-only JSONL audit log,
  one file per session, one line per proxied call, fsynced per event
  (architecture §9, ADR-015/016).
- `internal/escalation/` — the escalation queue (ADR-016): parked commands
  as atomic JSON records under
  `~/.hobbes/sessions/<session>/escalations/`, resolved by the CLI,
  expiring to deny.
- `internal/knowledge/` — the v1 knowledge-layer queries (ADR-017):
  `graph_neighborhood`, `who_calls`, `tests_guarding`, read from
  `.hobbes/derived/` with file:line provenance and staleness warnings.
- `internal/proxy/` — the M4 tool proxy: the MCP server standing between an
  agent session and the machine. `exec` (policy-resolved via
  `internal/policy`, logged via `internal/recorder`, escalations parked via
  `internal/escalation`) plus the read-only knowledge tools. Escalated
  commands park (blocking the call, with MCP progress notifications) and
  run in place once approved.
- `internal/sandbox/` — builds the rootless `podman run` invocation
  (ADR-018): fresh clone mounted rw, session state mounted rw, clean env,
  Claude Code wired to the proxy. Pure data, so the whole launch is
  `--dry-run`-inspectable.
- `cmd/hobbes-policy/` — CLI front-end. `hobbes-policy resolve` prints a JSON
  resolution and encodes the decision in its exit code
  (0 allow / 10 deny / 20 escalate — ADR-003). The Python `hobbes` CLI shells
  out to it.
- `cmd/hobbes-proxy/` — the per-session daemon (ADR-014): `hobbes-proxy
  serve --repo DIR --role ROLE` speaks MCP over stdio and logs to
  `~/.hobbes/sessions/<session>/flight.jsonl`. The M4 session wrapper lists
  it in the sandboxed Claude Code's MCP config. `hobbes-proxy escalations
  [list | approve <id> | deny <id>]` is the human side of the queue.
- `cmd/hobbes-session/` — the session wrapper (ADR-018): `hobbes-session
  start --repo DIR --role ROLE` clones a fresh worktree and launches Claude
  Code in a rootless Podman sandbox wired to the proxy. `--dry-run` prints
  the exact podman argv and MCP config. Image + exit check live in
  `../sandbox/`.
