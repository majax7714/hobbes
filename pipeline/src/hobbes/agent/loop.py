"""A minimal agent loop over an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint (ADR-056).

**Stdlib only, one file.** ``hobbes-session`` copies this file into the
session dir and runs it inside the sandbox with the image's ``python3``;
the pure benchmark arm runs it on the host. Either way it is the same
loop:

1. send the system prompt, the task, and the tool schemas;
2. execute every tool call the model returns — MCP tools through the
   hobbes-proxy over stdio (the sandbox's policy-checked ``exec`` and
   the knowledge tools), native ``bash`` only when no MCP config is
   given (the pure arm), and confined file tools either way;
3. feed the results back; stop when the model answers without tool
   calls or the turn budget runs out.

It prints one **result envelope** on stdout in Claude Code's shape
(``type: result``, ``usage``, ``duration_ms``, ``num_turns``,
``is_error``), so the benchmark's meter reads both runtimes with one
reader. Everything else goes to stderr.

Usage::

    loop.py --base-url URL --model NAME [--api-key-env VAR]
            (--prompt TEXT | --prompt-file FILE)
            [--mcp-config FILE] [--role ROLE] [--workdir DIR]
            [--max-turns N] [--max-tokens N] [--timeout SEC]

The API key is read from the environment variable named by
``--api-key-env`` (default ``HOBBES_LLM_API_KEY``); an unset variable
sends no ``Authorization`` header, which is what a private endpoint
wants.
