"""The two arms (ADR-055): Hobbes as a harness, and the model pure.

Both start from the same checkout (:mod:`hobbes.bench.workspace`) and
end in a candidate patch; everything between is what the comparison
measures.

**Harness arm.** ``ingest`` → ``plan`` → ``run`` → patch, exactly the
commands a human runs (ADR-051/054), with the issue text as the
proposal. The seeds are lexical (C-36): an instance whose issue names
no identifier the graph knows seeds nothing, and that is recorded as
the harness outcome ``no-seed`` — a failure of the harness arm, counted
against it, never dropped from the denominator (dropping it would
inflate the arm the benchmark exists to test). Every unit's session
runs in the ADR-018 sandbox through ``hobbes-session``; the partition
record, the plan summary, and the per-unit meters ride the record.

**Pure arm.** Claude Code on the same checkout with its own tools and
nothing of Hobbes — no MCP server, no policy, no derived context — the
issue text as the prompt. It runs where ``claude`` runs, on the host,
with shell access to the checkout (the benchmark repo's code can run;
the containment of the pure arm is an owner decision recorded with
ADR-055, not a default taken here). The result envelope is the meter.

Neither arm interprets its result. The verdict is the benchmark's
(:mod:`hobbes.bench.verdict`).
