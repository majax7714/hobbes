"""Records and the report (ADR-055).

One record per (instance, arm, model) in ``records.jsonl`` under the
run directory — instance facts (repo, created_at, the depth proxy),
the arm's outcome and patch shape, the meter, the verdict once the
evaluator has spoken, and for the harness arm the plan and run
summaries (the error stream). The report lays the records against
the three preregistered hypotheses and **computes, never interprets**:
it prints the rates, slopes, and per-solved costs with their sample
sizes and every unobserved term named, and leaves the reading to the
results section of ``docs/benchmark-hypotheses.md``.

Records with no verdict yet are excluded from every rate and counted
as such — a rate over unjudged patches would be a rate of "produced
something", which is not what any hypothesis asks.

**The planner hit (ADR-059, harness restructure phase 3).** A staged
harness record also carries, computed *here* from the instance's gold
patch after the arm has finished and never shown to any session,
whether the planner's named files reach a gold file. It is the first
number that says whether the generative layer above the lexical seeds
worked, independent of the solve — and it is a proxy: the gold patch
is one solution, not the only one (C-49).
