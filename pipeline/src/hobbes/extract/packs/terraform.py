"""Pack: the Terraform layer and its cross-layer joins (ADR-035, ADR-010).

The largest port and the one with the most hand-verified behaviour behind
it — the SELENEX ``packages`` edge checked by hand at
``infra-core/lambda.tf:5``, the ``env:VAR`` join that makes infra-to-code
environment coupling a visible edge, the tfstate refusal. So the pack is an
**adapter over the retained implementation** (:mod:`hobbes.extract.terraform`)
rather than a rewrite: same code, new and only caller. Rewriting 372 verified
lines for a structural change no user can observe is how a milestone about
removability becomes a milestone about regressions.

This is the one pack that contributes graph *nodes and edges* rather than
interface rows, and the only one that can tell the graph a language is
present — HCL has no lane of its own, so if this pack does not run, nothing
else will say the repo contains Terraform.
