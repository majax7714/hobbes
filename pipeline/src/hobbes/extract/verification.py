"""The verification base: how thin "supported" is, per language (C-31).

Architecture §3.8 is the sample behind every coverage claim (P11,
ADR-044): Python and TS/JS were hand-verified across several repos of
different shapes; **Go on exactly one repo — this one**; **Rust on one
small repo**. A table in a document is not a surfacing (the register's
own rule), so this module pins that table and :func:`extract_repo`
stamps it into ``graph.json`` as ``verification_base`` — keyed by the
artifact's own language names — where the ingest summary, the surface's
language badges, and ``list_blind_spots`` read it in the moment a
language list is read as a capability list.

The table is **pinned, not derived**: there is nothing in a repo that
could compute how many other repos Hobbes was verified on. Extending a
language's claim means extending §3.8 *and this table* in the same
commit as the evidence (§3.7 step 4) — the test suite holds the two in
agreement by checking each row here against the architecture's table.
A language the table does not know is reported as verified on **zero**
repos, never omitted: an ingest that names a language it cannot vouch
for is the claim this module exists to qualify.
