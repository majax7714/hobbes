"""Lane B: SCIP-proven edges joined onto lane A's structure (§3.2, §3.4).

The helper in ``scip/`` runs an indexer over a staging tree and hands back
definitions and references with file:line coordinates. This module does the
**range join** §3.4 describes: SCIP occurrences carry ranges, lane A's
symbols carry ranges, so a reference at ``file:line`` is attributed to
whichever lane-A symbol encloses it, and pointed at whichever lane-A symbol
its definition starts.

Joining on ranges rather than on ids is what keeps V2.M2 from churning node
identity: the graph's ids stay lane A's, and what lane B contributes is
*confidence* — the same edge, at ``tier: semantic`` instead of
``syntactic``. ADR-028 reserved a ``scip:`` namespace for ids lane B would
have to invent; the range join means M2 barely needs it.

Since ADR-029 the join is not between two finished edge sets but between
two *providers*: tree-sitter's call sites and SCIP's resolutions meet in
the evidence IR (:mod:`hobbes.extract.evidence`) before any graph exists.
This module's job is to get SCIP's facts into that IR and to project the
result back onto lane A's module and symbol ids.
