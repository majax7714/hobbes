"""The tail view: classify unresolved call sites by observation (ADR-045).

Resolution coverage (ADR-029, C-2) counts how many detected call sites
have no known destination. This module says what the uncounted remainder
*is* — by observation only, never by inference. Every class states a
checkable fact about the site:

- ``fallback-resolved`` — lane A's resolver produced a (syntactic) edge
  for this site; only the semantic provider came up empty.
- ``local-binding`` — the callee is a binding **below the modelled
  vocabulary in the same file** (C-9): a destructured setter, a handler
  ``const``, a nested function, a fixture parameter, a closure-typed
  ``:=`` target. Seen and deliberately not modelled — not unknown. Two
  proof grades, both observations (ADR-046): for TS/JS the checker
  resolved the declaration; for Python and Go, lane A's own parse
  recorded the binding *with its enclosing function's extent*, and the
  site matches only when that extent spans the call's line — scope
  containment, not a file-wide name coincidence.
- ``nested-decl`` — same, but the declaration lives in another repo file.
- ``external-origin`` — every declaration the checker found lives outside
  the repo: a dependency or an ambient lib. Known origin, unresolved call.
- ``import-binding`` — a bare call whose name an import statement **in
  the same file** binds (``from x import y as z`` binds ``z``). The
  binding is lane A's own parse, not a guess; what stays open is only
  where the imported thing's call would land — often a dependency the
  environment is missing (C-23/C-27/C-30), which is exactly when this
  class carries the tail. Added after the SELENEX/qwen run: their
  ``unclassified`` was almost entirely this (``PG_UUID``,
  ``load_dataset``, ``LLM`` — imports of the very packages
  ``dependency_coverage`` reported missing).
- ``builtin-name`` — a bare call whose name matches the language's pinned
  builtin list. The class says "matches": a local shadowing ``len`` would
  match too, and the name is honest about that. An import binding
  outranks a builtin match — ``from rich import print`` makes the
  import the truer observation about ``print(...)``.
- ``attr-call`` — an attribute call (``x.foo()``): a receiver no static
  provider could type. The genuine static-analysis limit, C-2's core.
- ``path-call`` — a ``::``-qualified call (Rust) the index left dark.
- ``unclassified`` — none of the above observations applies. This is the
  residue that stays honestly unknown.

The classes roll up into the two statements the ingest summary prints
(architecture §3.4): *seen and not modelled by design* (local-binding,
nested-decl, builtin-name) versus *cannot resolve* (everything else but
fallback-resolved, which has an edge and merely lacks proof).

Checker-origin classes are **TypeScript/JavaScript only** in this
version — the tsextract helper's checker knows declarations; the other
syntax providers do not resolve. The asymmetry, the pinned (not
runtime) builtin lists, and the text-based shape read are the
classifier's own boundaries, registered as C-32 — and the asymmetry is
*stated* per language by :data:`CLASSES_AVAILABLE`, which
``graph.json`` carries as ``tail_classes_available`` so a reader can
tell "no external-origin sites" from "no provider that reports them".
