"""Staging trees for lane B (ADR-027's safety contract).

The SCIP indexers only index what is under their ``--cwd``, and they need
a config file next to it. Rather than write that config into the repo and
delete it afterwards — a transient write into a tree Hobbes otherwise only
reads, which has to be crash-safe, interrupt-safe, and careful never to
remove a file it did not create — lane B indexes a **staging tree Hobbes
owns outright**, holding copies of the sources and the generated config.

Measured equivalent: python-only recall against lane A is 1.000 either way
(ADR-027), and staging SELENEX costs 9ms for 421KB against ~5.5s to index
it. There is no trade.

The contract this module exists to keep, clause by clause:

1. **Nothing is ever written to the target repo.** Every write lands under
   :func:`cache_root`.
2. **Authored source is copied, never linked.** A hardlink is a live handle
   into the user's tree — ``chmod`` through one changes the *original*
   file's mode. Refined by ADR-032: a *regenerable dependency tree*
   (``node_modules``) may be **symlinked**, because it is not authored, is
   reproducible from a lockfile, and is only ever read. TypeScript has no
   equivalent of Pyright's absolute ``venvPath``, and the measured
   alternative lost 6.4% of the semantic references the lane exists to
   produce. Two properties are asserted in the tests rather than assumed:
   indexing writes nothing through the link, and removing a stage unlinks
   it instead of recursing into the target (C-22).
3. **The staging path is derived**, not random, so removal is idempotent
   and a later run can find what an earlier one left.
4. **Removal refuses any path outside the cache root**, and takes no path
   that came from the repo or from a caller's string.
5. **The staged file set is lane A's discovered set**, not ``git
   ls-files`` — ``discover_modules`` never consults git, so it sees
   untracked files, and a mismatch would hand the two lanes different
   inputs and manufacture false disagreements in §3.4's report.
