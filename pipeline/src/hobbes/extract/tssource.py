"""TS/JS extraction: invoke the tsextract helper, join its facts (ADR-021).

The Node helper (``tsextract/extract.mjs``, ts-morph) does discovery and
checker-grade resolution and emits facts JSON; this module turns those
facts into the same graph/tests/interfaces shapes the Python extractor
produces. Module ids are repo-relative paths sans extension
(``src/flow``), symbol ids ``<module-id>.<qualname>``.

Setup is explicit, never silent: a repo with TS/JS files and no usable
helper fails ingest with instructions (skipping would make graph content
depend on the environment). ``HOBBES_TSEXTRACT_CMD`` overrides the
helper invocation — the ``HOBBES_POLICY_BIN`` precedent; tests use it
for canned facts.
