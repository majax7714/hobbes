"""Impact set → work units (ADR-051; agent-mapping §3.2).

Minimize cut coupling subject to a per-unit context budget:

- **node weight** — representation cost: the module's file, its
  guarding test files, and its module doc, estimated in tokens
  (bytes/4). What an agent must *hold* to own the module.
- **edge weight** — coupling: tier × edge-type weight × reference
  count × co-change factor. What separating two modules would *cost*.
- **constraint** — a unit's total weight fits the budget, held well
  below the window ceiling because accuracy degrades before capacity.

**Agent count is the partition's output, not a parameter.** A contained
change yields one unit; a cross-cutting one yields several; the
codebase decides. The merge is agglomerative and greedy — strongest
coupling first, deterministic tie-breaks — because the weights are
declared guesses (C-35) and a solver's optimality would be precision
painted onto numbers that have never been validated.

Two explicit failure rules from the design's §7: a unit whose contract
overhead reaches its interior weight merges into its strongest
neighbor (over-decomposition — coordination that costs more than the
code it coordinates), and a single module larger than the budget is
flagged ``oversize`` rather than split — the partition's grain is the
module, a stated D1 limit.
