"""Proposal → scored impact set (ADR-051; agent-mapping §3.1).

Seeds are resolved **lexically** — explicit ``--seed`` ids or paths,
plus proposal tokens matched exactly against node ids, node path stems,
and symbol names. Nothing is inferred from prose: a term that matches
nothing seeds nothing, and a *code-shaped* term that matches nothing is
reported in the change-spec rather than guessed at (C-36). A generative
planner may one day sit above this and emit seeds; it will never sit
inside it (P5).

Expansion is max-product score propagation over the module-projected
graph: a seed scores 1.0, and a neighbor's score is the best path
product of per-edge factors (tier weight × edge-type weight). Both
directions — a change's impact reaches the callers that depend on it
as much as the callees it depends on. Nodes at or above the pinned
threshold are the impact set. Every number here is a declared guess
(C-35); nothing claims the set is *right*, and the recorder milestone
is what will measure it.
