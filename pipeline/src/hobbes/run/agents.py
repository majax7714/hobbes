"""Materializing agents from a change-spec (ADR-054).

An agent is *(context slice, policy profile, verification
obligations)* (agent-mapping §1). This module writes each one down as
a directory the sandbox mounts read-only at ``/agent``:

- ``policy.yaml`` — the derived **agent** policy layer (``scope:
  agent``): the P10 guarantees first, as denies; the unit's guarding
  tests allowed to run; a human-first unit denied every write. It is
  loaded last in the chain and can only narrow (ADR-002).
- ``context.json`` — the manifest the proxy reads to tag **context
  faults**: interior, boundary, and neighborhood ids plus the
  interior's paths. A knowledge query outside them is served and
  tagged — the allocator's error signal.
- ``context.md`` — the **standing** context, rendered: interior,
  guarding tests, docs, in-scope invariants, contracts with their
  pins, one-hop signatures, and the stated complement (mandatory,
  ADR-047 — refused upstream without it, restated here so the agent
  reads it first, not last).
- ``brief.md`` — what the session is started with: the role, the
  proposal, the standing context, the **short-term** inbox, and the
  obligations (commit on the session branch; run the guards; reflect
  when a contract proves wrong rather than working around it).

What the base does **not** enforce is stated in the brief and
registered as C-38: write mounts are advisory at path grain (the
sandbox mounts the worktree whole; the orchestrator measures rework
against the manifest afterwards instead).
