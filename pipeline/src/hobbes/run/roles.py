"""Standing role policies (ADR-054).

The owner's structure gives every agent a policy made of the shared
repo policy plus a **per-role** policy. Roles here are the phases of
agent-mapping §2, not personas: ``planner`` (breaks the proposal down,
hands off, writes nothing), ``reviewer`` (judges a plan or a range),
``implementer`` (one per unit, writes inside its unit), ``verifier``
(reads the integrated result, writes nothing), ``orchestrator``
(sequences and arbitrates, owns no code).
The files live at ``.hobbes/policies/roles/<role>.policy`` with
``scope: role``; the Go engine loads the one matching the session's
role between the repo policy and any folder policy.

They are **standing** context: versioned with the repo and changed
only by commits. ``hobbes run`` scaffolds a missing one from the
templates below and never overwrites an existing one — a role policy
someone edited is intent, and intent is the human's (ADR-026).
