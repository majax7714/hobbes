# Extraction evidence — the repos Hobbes has been tested against

**Why this file exists (Max, 2026-08-18):** "carry a repos tested with
stats doc somewhere in the repo for honesty and proof." The plan is that
once extraction is properly validated, most development moves off of
testing and Hobbes work becomes last-commit additions — which makes the
extraction layer's evidence base the thing everything else stands on,
and an unwritten evidence base is a claim, not a proof.

**How to read this file.** One section per repo, newest results first
within it. Every number is **of detected call sites** (C-1/C-4/C-5 are
in no denominator here — the count is a floor, never "of the repo").
A row licenses exactly what it measured (P11): "ingested cleanly at
265k sites" is evidence about the machinery at scale, **not**
hand-verified edge accuracy — and rows say explicitly which they carry.
**Leaving edge verification out is fine as long as it is documented**
(Max, same direction), so the *Verified* line is mandatory in every
section, including when its content is "none". Architecture §3.8
remains the *claim* table — what "supported" means; this file is the
*evidence log* behind and beyond it. Update it **in the same commit**
as the test session that produced the numbers.

Fixture repos (`miniapp`, `minits`, `minigo`, `minirust`, the twomod
scratch fixture) are exercised by the test suite on every run and are
not logged here — this file is for real repos.

## hobbes (this repo — dogfood, continuous)

Six languages in its own graph (`go, hcl, javascript, python, rust,
typescript`). Re-ingested every session; the suite's degraded path
(lane B off) runs on every test invocation.

| Date | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-18 | 265 nodes, 915 module edges, 2,063 symbols, 4,207 call edges. Capture: go **89.2%** of 3,707 · python **88.3%** of 4,862 · rust **100%** of 18 · ts/js **61.6%** of 2,417. Unclassified residue: 0 python, 0 go (ADR-046), ~99 ts/js (the known fleet residue — helper/scip JS zones). Stable across the ADR-048/049 changes |
| 2026-08-16 (V2.M7 exit) | 3,085 sites, lanes **0 disagreements** across six languages |
| 2026-08-15 (V2.M3 exit) | lanes: 1,789 sites compared, **0 disagree** |

**Verified:** Go 20/20 call edges hand-checked at V2.M5 (ADR-037);
10/10 sampled narrative claims resolve (M5); the M8 exit check's
invariant regression replay (`hobbes review ace9a08..cdbc085`, exit 1).

## SELENEX (`~/SELENEX` — Python + JS + Terraform; read-only, Max-sanctioned)

| Date | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 (tail view) | python capture **94.3%** — best measured; unclassified 46 → 4 (import-binding, ADR-045 amendment) → **0** (ADR-046) |
| 2026-08-11 (M6 exit) | 207 nodes, 602 module edges (hcl+javascript+python); lanes 976 sites, **0 disagree** |

**Verified:** all 11 JS module edges + 9 call edges + 9 node:test
mappings + 1 pytest mapping hand-checked — 100% (M6 exit); the
cross-layer `packages` edge at `infra-core/lambda.tf:5 → handler.py`
hand-verified (M3).

## kbet (`~/projects/kbet` — real Vite+React TS app; throwaway tier)

| Date | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 | tail: 61% below-floor locals; **9 of 1,339** sites unclassifiable |
| 2026-08-15 (V2.M3/C-24) | **231 semantic TS call edges**; 12 test→component render edges, all semantic; 108/174 tests reach a component; lanes 359 sites, **0 disagree** |
| 2026-08-11 (M6) | 104 nodes, 174 tests |

**Verified:** 20/20 semantic call edges hand-checked against cited
lines (V2.M3, discharging M2's asterisk); 20/20 edges + 10/10 test
mappings at M6.

## qwen-pathology (`~/qwen-pathology` — Python)

| Date | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 | capture **82.6%** of 546; environment gap surfaced (2/6 deps installed — datasets, transformers, vllm missing, C-27's WARNING); unclassified 6 → **1** |

**Verified:** none — its role is the env-missing degradation path,
which it exercised (documented, not hand-checked).

## rust_proj (`~/rust_proj` — small Rust crate)

| Date | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 (V2.M7 exit) | 33 call edges, **all semantic**; lanes clean at 17 sites |

**Verified:** 33/33 — 100% hand-checked (the P7 proof, ADR-040). One
small repo: this is the entirety of Rust's evidence base, which is why
§3.8 scopes the Rust claim to it.

## dagger (`~/dagger` — the Dagger automation engine; ~460 MB)

The first deep-extraction target (2026-08-18, ADR-048/049): four graph
languages, **84 TS zones, 25 Go modules, ~265,000 detected call
sites** — ~50× the largest prior measurement. Its role is scale and
monorepo structure, and it earned three fixes and one lifted
constraint in two days.

| Run | Numbers |
|---|---|
| 3rd — after the cross-unit join (ADR-049) | go **85.6%** of 237,728 — cannot-resolve 20,501 → **5,571** (attr-call 4,655, unclassified 219); `core/integration [go]` **59.3% → 96.3%** (cannot-resolve 14,902 → 396). **161,184 call edges (+8,014 semantic)**, 24,723 module edges; **7,322** semantic `core/integration → sdk/go` edges (the `replace`d SDK, C-33's exact case). Two `scip-merge` abstentions reported (42 anonymous-TS-zone monikers, 7 generated Go testdata modules — C-28's rule across units, exactness holding). Lanes: 36,440 dual-resolved, **still 138 disagree — zero added by the join**. python/rust/ts unchanged, as they should be |
| 2nd — after wrapped-chain + per-unit degradation (ADR-048) | go **79.3%** of 237,728 (unclassified **359**, was 9,131) · python **89.1%** of 6,382 · rust **94.2%** of 8,595 · ts/js **18.8%** of 12,503 (`sdk/typescript` **63.7%**, was 0 — the docs zone now fails alone). 4,872 nodes, 24,452 module edges, 153,170 call edges. Lanes: 36,439 dual-resolved sites, **138 disagree (0.38%)** — 126 Go (fallback vs build tags/interface dispatch: C-7/C-8's floor measured), 11 a TS decorator line-convention off-by-one, both lanes citing the same declaration |
| 1st — baseline | go 79.3% (unclassified 9,131 — wrapped fluent chains) · ts/js **0.0%** (one broken docs zone zeroed all 84 zones) · python 89.1% · rust 94.2%. Found C-33: zero semantic edges from the root module into the `replace`d `./sdk/go` |

**Verified:** **no hand-checked edges** — documented deliberately
(Max: "leaving edge verification is fine as long as its documented").
What dagger evidences is the honesty machinery and the monorepo
structural fixes at scale, plus the two-module fixture's 0% → 100%
flip (`semantic`/`calls`) proving the C-33 lift's mechanism exactly.
No §3.8 row exists for dagger and none is licensed by these runs.
