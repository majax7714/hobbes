## 2026-08-10 — Repo scaffold + M0 (skeleton & policy semantics)

**Built:**

- Monorepo scaffolded per the D1 split: `go/`, `pipeline/`, `web/`
  (placeholder until M7), `docs/` (source docs moved here from the repo
  root), `.hobbes/` (`policies/` + `invariants/` versioned, `derived/` and
  `*.tfstate` gitignored from day one). Root README, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE,
  .gitignore.
- ADRs 001–004: policy YAML schema & file locations, resolution tie-breaks &
  defaults, the `hobbes-policy resolve` CLI contract (JSON + exit codes
  0/10/20), and M0 tooling choices (yaml.v3 + stdlib `flag`; argparse + uv).
- Go policy engine (`go/internal/policy`): strict-YAML parsing, box → repo →
  folder chain loader (nested folder policies, deepest most specific), and
  the resolution algorithm — deny wins from any scope, otherwise
  most-specific scope decides, escalate beats allow within a scope, unmatched
  commands fall back to the most specific `default:` (engine fallback:
  escalate). 52 test cases covering shadowing, deny-wins,
  folder-over-repo-over-box precedence, the escalate tier, defaults, glob
  matching, loading, and CLI exit codes. `go vet` clean.
- `hobbes-policy resolve` CLI (`go/cmd/hobbes-policy`) per ADR-003.
- Python `hobbes` CLI skeleton (`pipeline/`): `init`/`ingest`/`diff` stubs
  that name their delivering milestone, plus `hobbes policy resolve`
  passthrough (binary via `$HOBBES_POLICY_BIN` then `$PATH`). 17 hermetic
  pytest cases (fake binary — no Go toolchain needed to run them).
- Dogfood `.hobbes/policies/repo.policy` for this repo (tfstate deny,
  force-push deny, build/test allows, `git push` escalate). Verified
  end-to-end: Python CLI → Go binary → this repo's policy returns
  allow/deny/escalate with exit 0/10/20.

**Changed from plan:**

- Nothing substantive. Housekeeping: the two source docs moved from the repo
  root into `docs/`. Toolchain installed user-locally (no passwordless sudo
  on this box): Go 1.26.5 at `~/.local/go/bin`, uv 0.12.3 at `~/.local/bin`.
- One reconciliation, recorded in ADR-001: architecture §5.1 sketches the
  repo policy at `.hobbes/repo.policy` while §10's layout puts hand-reviewed
  policy under `.hobbes/policies/`; went with §10
  (`.hobbes/policies/repo.policy`). Folder policies stay
  `<folder>/.hobbes/folder.policy` per §5.1.

**Open questions for Max:**

1. LICENSE defaulted to MIT (you asked for a LICENSE file but didn't name
   one) — swap if you want something else.
2. ADR-002: engine fallback for a command no rule matches is **escalate**
   (not deny) — deliberate, since escalation itself expires to deny at the
   enforcement layer. Confirm or overturn.
3. ADR-002: escalate is shadowable by a more specific scope's allow; only
   deny is absolute. That's my reading of §5.1 — confirm.
4. Commits were made directly on `main` (matching the repo's existing
   history). Say the word if you'd rather have milestone branches + PRs.

**M0 exit criteria:** policy merge tests green (shadowing, deny-wins,
precedence, escalate tier) ✔ · repo scaffolded ✔ · docs written ✔.
Awaiting review before M1.
